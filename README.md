# kiro-proxy

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [Documentation](#documentation)

`kiro-proxy` exposes Claude Messages, OpenAI Chat Completions, and OpenAI Responses
compatible APIs through a multi-provider architecture with built-in Kiro and GitHub
Copilot adapters. The Rust daemon `kproxyd` handles routing, generation, and account
scheduling; `kproxy` manages all providers, or one provider, through a local Unix socket.

Kiro supports enterprise SSO credentials (AWS IAM Identity Center/IdC) and imported
headless API keys (`ksk_...`). Copilot supports GitHub Device Flow or token import from
standard input. Upstream credentials and the proxy's client API keys are separate.
The project has no GUI, MITM, or local client configuration rewriting.

> Documentation follows the current source, whose workspace version is `0.2.4`.
> It includes **unreleased changes after the `v0.2.4` tag**, including the CLI
> migration. A prebuilt `v0.2.4` image does not include those changes. See the
> [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [1.0.0 assessment](docs/release-readiness-1.0.0.zh-CN.md).

## Capabilities and limits

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| APIs | Messages, token counting, Chat Completions, Responses, model discovery; JSON and SSE generation. |
| Accounts | Provider-isolated pools, per-account concurrency, enable/disable, tags, probes and refresh; Kiro quota scheduling and Copilot Device Flow. |
| Upstream routing | Regional Kiro runtimes and GovCloud isolation; Copilot short-lived API tokens, dynamic endpoints and native protocol forwarding. |
| Models and tools | Cross-provider discovery, conditional mapping and access scopes; Kiro tool replay, Claude Tool Search and Web Search. |
| Operations | Hot-reloaded TOML, API-key quotas, TLS, webhooks, trace logs, persisted statistics, Docker and systemd. |
| Compatibility limits | Format/strict hints do not guarantee structured output. Responses state expires and is lost on restart. Hosted tools and automatic compaction differ by protocol. |

The default client policy accepts Claude Code on Claude routes and Codex on
OpenAI generation routes; model discovery accepts both. Other clients can use a
service or API-key exemption. Authentication and service key allowlists still
apply. Read the [protocol reference](docs/protocol-compatibility.md) and
[Responses support matrix](docs/openai-responses.md) before integrating a client.

## Quick start

Run commands from a checkout of this repository. Native operation uses Unix
sockets; Linux and macOS are the intended native environments. The published
Docker workflow targets **Linux amd64** with the full SSO image.

### Docker on a Linux server

With Docker Engine and a working `docker compose` command:

```bash
./deploy/docker-setup.sh
kproxy health
```

The setup script pulls the image before replacing the container, checks daemon
health, attempts image rollback on deployment failure, and installs the matching
host CLI wrapper. State lives in the `kproxy-data` volume. The default wrapper
path is `/usr/local/bin/kproxy`; use `--target "$HOME/.local/bin/kproxy"` for a
user-owned location and include that directory in `PATH`.

Fresh setup uses `latest`; subsequent setup reuses the saved image reference.
Use `./deploy/docker-upgrade.sh` to follow `latest`, or `--image` to choose a
published tag/digest. Use `./deploy/docker-setup.sh --build` to run the current
checkout, including unreleased features. Private GHCR packages require login.

Compose uses host networking. Linux supports it directly; Docker Desktop needs
host networking enabled. A newly created service defaults to `0.0.0.0:5580`;
restrict its port or choose loopback as shown below. Deployment health alone does
not prove that generation works. See the [deployment guide](docs/startup-and-debugging.md#8-docker-compose)
for platform requirements, upgrades, backup, rollback, and uninstall behavior.

### Native build

Install rustup and a C toolchain/linker. `rust-toolchain.toml` selects Rust 1.97.1
(edition 2021). The default build includes browser SSO; native SSO login also
requires an installed Chrome/Chromium.

```bash
cp .env.example .env             # First setup only; keep an existing .env
cargo build --release --locked
./target/release/kproxyd
```

In another terminal at the repository root:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
kproxy health
kproxy config path
```

The example `.env` stores development state under `.kproxy-dev`. The daemon and
CLI business commands load the nearest `.env` upward from the working directory;
existing environment variables win. CLI help, guides, completion, and version
work without `.env` or a daemon. Use an absolute `KPROXY_HOME` when invoking the
programs from different directories. See [environment and paths](docs/startup-and-debugging.md#2-environment-loading).

### Add credentials and create a service

A fresh daemon has no business listener. Choose one credential import method:

```bash
kproxy account import --stdin < /secure/accounts.json
# Alternative: reads KIRO_API_KEY from the CLI environment
kproxy account add-api-key --email ci@example.com --region us-east-1
```

Then create a service and save its printed client key:

```bash
kproxy service create --name main --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5580
kproxy account list
kproxy models list
kproxy ready
```

Do not reuse a `ksk_...` upstream key as the proxy client key. Import schemas,
SSO login and credential handling are covered in [account setup](docs/startup-and-debugging.md#4-add-or-import-accounts).
`health` checks daemon liveness; `ready` checks business prerequisites. A real
generation request additionally verifies the upstream route and consumes quota.

### Kiro overage credits

Inspect or change the policy for the entire Kiro account pool with the account
command:

```bash
# Enable overage with a 500-credit maximum for each account
kproxy account overage enable --max-credits 500

# Show the policy and per-account proxy/Kiro limits
kproxy account overage

# Refresh Kiro usage before displaying it
kproxy account overage show --refresh

# Disable overage while retaining the configured maximum
kproxy account overage disable
```

`enable` and `disable` update the configuration atomically and reload it.
`enable` also refreshes Kiro usage by default. Use
`kproxy account overage enable --kiro-limit` to rely entirely on Kiro's
reported cap. You can also edit the equivalent settings in the `config.toml`
shown by `kproxy config path`:

```toml
[pool]
enable_overage = true
max_overage_credits_per_account = 500.0
```

It is off by default. With it off, plan and bonus credits remain subject to
low credit protection and exhaustion checks. With it on, the proxy includes
Kiro's reported overage cap. If `max_overage_credits_per_account` is omitted,
the proxy retains the original switch behavior and does not pause accounts
based on its local balance. When set, the maximum applies separately to every
account: new requests stop once usage reaches the non-overage limit plus the
smaller of Kiro's overage cap and this setting. The low credit threshold does
not apply. For example, a 10,000 credit plan with a 10,000 credit Kiro overage
cap and a 500 credit proxy maximum has an effective limit of 10,500.

The proxy uses the latest known usage when admitting requests, so requests
already in flight can exceed this maximum. Upstream quota rejections and the
service daily credit limit still apply. After manually editing TOML, run
`kproxy config reload`, then `kproxy tasks run status_check` to refresh Kiro's
overage values. Inspect `kproxy config show pool --effective` and
`kproxy pool --model claude-sonnet-4.6 --explain`. In `kproxy account list`,
the quota column shows current usage, the proxy's configured total, and Kiro's
server total, for example `10000.01/10500.00/20000.00`. The
`Overage(configured/Kiro)` column shows the per-account proxy maximum and
Kiro's reported cap together.

## Connect a client

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Claude Messages; aliases `/messages` and `/anthropic/v1/messages`. |
| `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | Local token estimates; the Claude aliases also support `/count_tokens`. |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions; alias `/chat/completions`. |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses; alias `/responses`. |
| `GET /v1/models` | Model discovery for both clients; alias `/models`. |
| `GET /health`, `GET /ready` | Liveness and readiness on an existing service listener. |

For Claude Code, set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:5580` and
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to the service's client key. Large MCP catalogs can use
`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto`; gateway model discovery uses
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`.

For Codex, use `http://127.0.0.1:5580/v1` and `wire_api = "responses"`. The
[Codex setup guide](docs/openai-responses.md) includes the provider configuration,
state limits, unsupported controls, and stream errors. Select an available model
from `kproxy models list`; aliases do not enlarge an actual model's input window.

## Daily operations

```bash
kproxy status
kproxy stats --since 1h
kproxy logs show --tail 100
kproxy logs trace <TRACE_ID>
kproxy config show --effective
kproxy service list
kproxy help --all
kproxy help logs trace
kproxy guide balance
```

Bare command groups show help. Scripts must use explicit actions such as
`logs show`, `models list`, `tasks list`, and `diagnose all`; the last command
performs real inference on all accounts. Read the [CLI migration](docs/startup-and-debugging.md#migration-from-the-old-cli)
before updating scripts. Use [startup and troubleshooting](docs/startup-and-debugging.md)
for configuration, log retention, Docker lifecycle commands and systemd.

## Development

The workspace crates separate domain/configuration, storage, IPC, translation,
provider adapters, upstream access, scheduling, notifications, the daemon and the CLI.
See [contributor guidance](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [architecture notes](CLAUDE.md).

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
```

These are required checks, not a claim that the current checkout passes them.
The [release assessment](docs/release-readiness-1.0.0.zh-CN.md) records the audited
results and remaining gates; its [release checklist](docs/release-readiness-1.0.0.zh-CN.md#发布执行清单) explains tag
and image behavior. The project is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE).
